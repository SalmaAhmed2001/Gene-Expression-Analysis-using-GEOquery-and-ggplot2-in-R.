# Gene-Expression-Analysis-using-GEOquery-and-ggplot2-in-R.
This program utilizes the GEOquery and ggplot2 libraries in R for gene expression analysis.

This program package demonstrates how to perform gene expression analysis using the GEOquery and ggplot2 libraries in R. The code downloads gene expression data from the GEO database, extracts the expression values, and performs a t-test on the mean expression values of the test and control groups. 

The code also creates a boxplot of the gene expression data and separate boxplots for the test and control groups. Finally, a scatterplot matrix is created to visualize the correlation between the expression values in the test and control groups. This code can be used as a starting point for gene expression analysis using publicly available datasets.
